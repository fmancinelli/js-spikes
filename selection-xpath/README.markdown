Information
===========

This experiment grabs a selection range, compute the XPath of the start and end container, and serializes the information, including the start and end offset.

Once the range is serialized it is possible to restore the selection by pressing a button.

Running it
----------

* Run make to generate Javascript files (you need will need [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) to do this)  
* Open the index.html file and select a text while pressing the CTRL key.
